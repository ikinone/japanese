Some cool resources for learning about Japanese/Culture, will edit as I think of stuff

----------------

*Inspiration*
----------------
*Movies* (I recommend acquiring them (of course) in Japanese, with English subs. Japanese subtitles can be hard to get, but if you can find, would be great for learning quickly.)
* I'd recommend this to anyone: Studio Ghibli. Going through them in chronological order is reasonable, but certainly not needed. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Studio_Ghibli#Feature_works

*Series*
* Cowboy bebop (Series, followed by movie)
* Samurai Champloo (Incase you're wondering: https://jisho.org/search/chanpuru)

*Manga*
* One piece (read in English is fine, it's a big bit of popular culture, and an amazing story, if you can find in Japanese, it can be good to help learning - many Manga aimed at wide audience use 'furigana' which help you to read complex Kanji)
* Vagabond (Good insight to Sengoku period of feudal Japan, following events of a wandering samurai after the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Sekigahara Dives in to topics like honor, fighting spirit, zen, etc)
